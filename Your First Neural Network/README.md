## Project Overview
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Instructions
1- Download the project materials from our GitHub repository.
You can get download the [Repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git) with git clone  
2- cd into ``` first-neural-network ``` directory
3- Create a new conda environment:
```
conda create --name dlnd python=3
```
4- Enter your new environment:
```
activate dlnd
```
5- ensure you have 
``` 
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```
6- Run the following to open up the notebook server:
```
jupyter notebook
```
7-In your browser, open 
``` 
Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```
8- Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the
```
my_answers.py
```
python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
